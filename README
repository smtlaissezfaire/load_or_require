== LoadOrRequire

  What's the proper way to load a file in rails?
  
    require  => wrong
    load     => wrong
    autoload => who knows
  
  It all depends on your environment settings.  Some env's have cache_classes = true (e.g., production, 
  which uses require), others have cache_classes = false (e.g. development, for auto-reloading).

== Usage

   load_or_require "my_file"
